# Hello! I'm Ashraf ðŸ‘‹
<p>A Front-End Developer specialized in React.js. </p>
<p>I have a strong passion for building modern, responsive web applications using technologies like <i>React</i>, <i>JavaScript</i>, and the broader <i>âš¡MERN</i> stack. Iâ€™ve built multiple full-stack projects from scratch, giving me hands-on experience with both client-side interfaces and server-side logic. While I focus primarily on front-end development, Iâ€™m also comfortable working in the <i>Node.js</i> environment. Iâ€™ve implemented custom user authentication using <i>JSON Web Tokens (JWT)</i>, handled secure API requests, and managed data flow between front-end and back-end with ease. I enjoy solving problems, refining user experiences, and bringing ideas to life through code. Currently, Iâ€™m deepening my skills in advanced React development and exploring real-world patterns to build scalable, dynamic interfaces.</p>
